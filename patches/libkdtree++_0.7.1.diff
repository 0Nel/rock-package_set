+Description: C++ template container implementation of kd-tree sorting
+ libkdtree++ is a C++ template container implementation of k-dimensional space
+ sorting, using a kd-tree. It:
+ .
+   - supports an unlimited number of dimensions (in theory)
+   - can store any data structure, provided the data structure provides
+     operator[0 - k-1] to access the individual dimensional
+     components (arrays, std::vector already do) and a std::less
+     implementation for the type of dimensional components
+   - has support for custom allocators
+   - implements iterators
+   - provides standard find as well as range queries
+   - has amortised O(lg n) time (O(n lg n) worst case) on most
+     operations (insert/erase/find optimised) and worst-case O(n) space
+   - provides a means to rebalance and thus optimise the tree
+   - exists in its own namespace
+   - uses STL coding style, basing a lot of the code on stl_tree.h
+ .
+ It's not yet documented, although the usage should be fairly straight
+ forward. I am hoping to find someone else to document it as I suck at
+ documentation and as the author, it's exceptionally difficult to stay
+ didactically correct.
+ .
+ libkdtree++ only exists as a -dev package as it's only a bunch of C++ header
+ files. Therefore, no static or shared library is necessary, allowing for
+ ultimate flexibility.

+Notes on 0.7.0
+--------------
+
+The version shipped as 0.7.0 in Debian isn't actually the official 0.7.0
+release. It's a snapshot of 222b5d77 that can be downloaded from
+http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=libkdtree/libkdtree.git;a=commit;h=222b5d7.
+
+The version in Debian is missing the Python bindings and some changes to
+the ChangeLog and the cmake build system.

+
+Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
+document, but changing it is not allowed.
+
+Preamble
+~~~~~~~~
+This license establishes the terms under which a given free software Package
+may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed. The intent is that
+the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic control over the development of
+that Package while still keeping the Package available as open source and free
+software.
+
+You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this license
+directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the terms of this
+license do not permit the full use that you propose to make of the Package,
+you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek a different licensing
+arrangement.
+
+Definitions
+~~~~~~~~~~~
+"Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in the
+copyright notice for the entire Package.
+
+"Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other material to
+the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's procedures.
+
+"You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy, distribute, or
+modify the Package.
+
+"Package" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder,
+and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A given Package may
+consist of either the Standard Version, or a Modified Version.
+
+"Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it accessible to
+anyone else, or in the case of a company or organization, to others outside of
+your company or organization.
+
+"Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this Package
+or providing support for this Package to another party. It does not mean
+licensing fees.
+
+"Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been modified, or has
+been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.
+
+"Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such changes
+were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.
+
+"Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the
+Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may be
+modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.
+
+"Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and configuration
+files for the Package.
+
+"Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or any other
+form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of the Source
+form.
+
+Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+(1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use Modified
+Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that you do not
+Distribute the Modified Version.
+
+Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+(2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the Standard
+Version of this Package in any medium without restriction, either gratis or
+for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate all of the original
+copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At your discretion, such
+verbatim copies may or may not include a Compiled form of the Package.
+
+(3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other modifications
+made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting Package will still be
+considered the Standard Version, and as such will be subject to the Original
+License.
+
+Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+(4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or for
+a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the Modified
+Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs from the Standard
+Version, including, but not limited to, documenting any non-standard features,
+executables, or modules, and provided that you do at least ONE of the
+following:
+
+    (a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the
+        Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright
+        Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version.
+    (b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the
+        user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the
+        Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of
+        the Standard Version.
+    (c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the
+        Source form of the Modified Version available to others under
+        (i) the Original License or
+        (ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and
+             redistribute the Modified Version using the same licensing terms
+             that apply to the copy that the licensee received, and requires
+             that the Source form of the Modified Version, and of any works
+             derived from it, be made freely available in that license fees
+             are prohibited but Distributor Fees are allowed.
+
+Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified Versions
+without the Source
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+(5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without the
+Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to get the
+Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be valid at the time of
+your distribution. If these instructions, at any time while you are carrying
+out such distribution, become invalid, you must provide new instructions on
+demand or cease further distribution. If you provide valid instructions or
+cease distribution within thirty days after you become aware that the
+instructions are invalid, then you do not forfeit any of your rights under
+this license.
+
+(6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the Source,
+provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the Source of the
+Modified Version.
+
+Aggregating or Linking the Package
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+(7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or Modified
+Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting aggregation provided
+that you do not charge a licensing fee for the Package. Distributor Fees are
+permitted, and licensing fees for other components in the aggregation are
+permitted. The terms of this license apply to the use and Distribution of the
+Standard or Modified Versions as included in the aggregation.
+
+(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other works,
+to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to build stand-alone
+binary or bytecode versions of applications that include the Package, and
+Distribute the result without restriction, provided the result does not expose
+a direct interface to the Package.
+
+Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that merely
+extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause the Package to
+be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not considered parts of the
+Package itself, and are not subject to the terms of this license.
+
+General Provisions
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+(10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified
+Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using, modifying or
+distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not use, modify, or
+distribute the Package, if you do not accept this license.
+
+(11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version made by
+someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to ensure that your
+Modified Version complies with the requirements of this license.
+
+(12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark, service
+mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.
+
+(13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide, free-of-charge patent
+license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import and otherwise
+transfer the Package with respect to any patent claims licensable by the
+Copyright Holder that are necessarily infringed by the Package. If you
+institute patent litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against
+any party alleging that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent
+infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the date
+that such litigation is filed.
+
+(14) Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER
+AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE
+IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR
+NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL LAW.
+UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL BE LIABLE FOR
+ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY
+OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
+DAMAGE.
