    <description brief="LIBVISO2: C++ Library for Visual Odometry 2">
        LIBVISO2 (Library for Visual Odometry 2) is a very fast cross-platfrom (Linux, Windows)
        C++ library with MATLAB wrappers for computing the 6 DOF motion of a moving mono/stereo
        camera. The stereo version is based on minimizing the reprojection error of sparse
        feature matches and is rather general (no motion model or setup restrictions except that
        the input images must be rectified and calibration parameters are known). The monocular
        version is still very experimental and uses the 8-point algorithm for fundamental matrix
        estimation. It further assumes that the camera is moving at a known and fixed height over
        ground (for estimating the scale). Due to the 8 correspondences needed for the 8-point
        algorithm, many more RANSAC samples need to be drawn, which makes the monocular algorithm
        slower than the stereo algorithm, for which 3 correspondences are sufficent to estimate
        parameters
