  <description brief="solver for nonlinear equations and nonlinear least squares problems">
  Five algorithmic paths each include a core subroutine and an easy-to-use
  driver. The algorithms proceed either from an analytic specification of the
  Jacobian matrix or directly from the problem functions. The paths include
  facilities for systems of equations with a banded Jacobian matrix, for least
  squares problems with a large amount of data, and for checking the consistency
  of the Jacobian matrix with the functions.

  In Rock, this is included mainly for the purpose of compiling the PCL
  (slam/pcl)
