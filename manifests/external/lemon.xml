    <description brief="Library for Efficient Modeling and Optimization in Networks">
        LEMON stands for Library for Efficient Modeling and Optimization in Networks. It is a C++
        template library providing efficient implementations of common data structures and
        algorithms with focus on combinatorial optimization tasks connected mainly with graphs and
        networks.
        LEMON is a member of the COIN-OR initiative, a collection of OR related open source
        projects. You are free to use it in your commercial or non-commercial applications under
        very permissive license terms.
        The project was launched by the Egerváry Research Group on Combinatorial Optimization
        (EGRES) at the Department of Operations Research, Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest,
        Hungary in 2003. Up to this point, the developers of the library work at the Eötvös Loránd
        University, Budapest and at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics.
