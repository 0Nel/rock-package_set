    <description brief="Graph Exchange XML Format">
        GEXF (Graph Exchange XML Format) is a language for describing complex networks structures, their
        associated data and dynamics. Started in 2007 at Gephi project by different actors, deeply involved
        in graph exchange issues, the gexf specifications are mature enough to claim being both extensible
        and open, and suitable for real specific applications.
