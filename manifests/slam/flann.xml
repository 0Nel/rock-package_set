  <description brief="Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors">
  FLANN is a library for performing fast approximate nearest neighbor searches
  in high dimensional spaces. It contains a collection of algorithms we found to
  work best for nearest neighbor search and a system for automatically choosing
  the best algorithm and optimum parameters depending on the dataset.

  FLANN is written in C++ and contains bindings for the following languages: C,
  MATLAB and Python.
